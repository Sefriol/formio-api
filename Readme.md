This library is still under heavy initial development. It is not recommended for use at this time.

# Form API
This library is designed to create REST APIs for forms generated with the form.io system. It is designed to have a pluggable architecture where it does not rely on a specific DB and can run in both the browser (service workers) and on the server (node.js). 

## Usage
In order to use this library you need to import FormApi into your own application and pass in a db wrapper and express instance to it. Details to come.
